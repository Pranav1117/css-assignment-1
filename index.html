    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <div class="a">
      <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style SHeets.</li>
        <li>
          CSS describes how HTML elements are displayed on screen,paper or in
          other media.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="ab">Css is not necessary </span>
          <span class="highlight">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control
          the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
        <li class="abcd">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>

      <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
      <span class="space"
        ><ul>
          <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
          <li>
            Internal - by using a style element to link to an external CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            External - by using link element to link to an external CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external
            CSS files. However,<span class="highlight">
              in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span
            >
            because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
            for yourself.
          </li>
        </ul></span

      <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a
        style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use
        special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
        of style can be applied to the element.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
        used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
